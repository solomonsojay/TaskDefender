# 🔥 Firebase Setup Checklist for TaskDefender

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### **1. Update Firestore Security Rules (CRITICAL)**
🚨 **This is the most important step!**

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select project: **taskdefender-68cfd**
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
4. Replace current rules with the rules from `FIREBASE_SECURITY_RULES.md`
5. Click **"Publish"**

### **2. Verify Authentication Settings**
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
2. Ensure **Email/Password** is enabled
3. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized domains**
4. Verify these domains are added:
   - `localhost`
   - `taskdefender-68cfd.firebaseapp.com`
   - `*.webcontainer.io`
   - `*.bolt.new`

### **3. Test the Integration**
After updating the rules, test:
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] Email verification is sent
- [ ] User can sign in after verification
